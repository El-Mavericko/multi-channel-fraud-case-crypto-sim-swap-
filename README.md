# Multi-Channel SIM Swap Fraud ‚Äì Crypto + Banking Exploit Case Study

## Overview

This case study outlines a real-world, multi-channel fraud event involving:
- SIM Swap attack
- Customer account impersonation
- Exploitation of financial services and crypto exchanges

The objective of this repo is to:
- Highlight how a single point of compromise (mobile number) can cascade into multi-platform exploitation
- Document effective frontline fraud mitigation strategies
- Demonstrate the importance of telco-level security in protecting digital assets

## Case Summary

- **Attack Type:** SIM Swap + Social Engineering  
- **Victim Impact:**  
  - ¬£20,000 lost through unauthorized Apple Pay transactions  
  - ¬£2,000 lost from compromised cryptocurrency accounts (Binance, Kraken)  
- **Exploit Path:**

## Fraud Response Protocol (Analyst Role)

1. Identified abnormal account activity and unauthorized SIM reissue  
2. Voided the eSIM by initiating a physical SIM re-order for the customer  
3. Collected verification logs for internal fraud reporting  
4. Completed formal fraud documentation for case tracking  
5. Requested official fraud confirmation letter to support customer‚Äôs external claims  
6. Remediated the customer‚Äôs digital profile and restored service integrity

## Outcome

- Prevented further financial loss by revoking fraudster access early  
- Enabled customer to initiate recovery procedures with banks and crypto exchanges  
- Strengthened internal awareness of SIM swap risk vectors and impersonation tactics

---

## Key Insights

- SIM swap fraud can serve as a gateway to high-value financial compromise  
- Weakness in user-facing verification (social engineering) remains a critical vulnerability  
- Cross-industry collaboration (telecom, fintech, crypto) is essential to combat modern fraud

---

## Strategic Implications

This case underscores the need for:
- Stronger device fingerprinting and behavioral analytics during customer interactions  
- Account change velocity monitoring (multiple changes within short windows)  
- Shared fraud intelligence between telecoms and financial institutions
